# Hero Ranking System

## Overview

This database uses a **hybrid ranking approach** combining manual community assessments with automated technical analysis.

## Ranking Methods

### 1. **Community Tier Rankings** (Primary Reference)
- **Location:** `/tierlist/` page
- **Based on:** Practical gameplay experience and testing
- **Tiers:** SSS, SS, S, A, B, C, D
- **Factors:** Damage, survivability, utility, team synergies, versatility
- **Updated:** When new heroes are released or meta shifts

**Use this when:** Deciding which hero to build or use in content

### 2. **Technical Power Score** (Secondary Reference)
- **Location:** `/rankings/` page
- **Calculated from:**
  - **Skills (30%)** - Damage multipliers, AoE, CC effects, utility
  - **Synergies (15%)** - Team support capabilities  
  - **Stats (55%)** - HP, ATK, Armor, Resistance
  
**Use this when:** Comparing mechanical strengths or understanding why heroes are rated differently

## Why the Difference?

Some heroes like **Hladgunnr** (SS tier, PvE SSS) have:
- High skill damage potential (Carry role)
- Lower team synergy contributions
- Great solo performance

But might score lower on automated rankings because:
- They don't provide team buffs (Energy, ATK Speed, etc.)
- Solo-carry mechanics aren't fully captured in formulas
- Practical "carry potential" is hard to quantify

## How to Use

1. **For General Reference:** Check `/tierlist/` for quick tier assessment
2. **For Hero Comparison:** Use `/rankings/` to see technical breakdowns
3. **For Detailed Info:** Visit individual hero pages for skills and synergies
4. **For PvE/PvP:** Check hero ratings - they differentiate game modes

## Limitations

- Automatic scoring doesn't capture matchups or meta-specific counters
- Manual tiers are subjective and based on specific testing conditions
- Different team compositions may favor different heroes
- Patch changes can shift hero viability

## The Bottom Line

**🎯 When in doubt, use the tier list!** It's based on real gameplay, not just formulas.
