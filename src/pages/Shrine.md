Shrine:

- General
The Shrine is one of the core systems in the game, mainly responsible for acquiring equipment, called Artefacts.

The heroes you place in the Shrine provide special effects that are completely independent from the main game.

Hero Rules inside the Shrine
Campaign progress does NOT affect shrine heroes

Hero level does NOT matter
Equipped gear does NOT matter

👉 The only thing that matters for a hero in the Shrine is their rarity.

A hero’s effectiveness in the Shrine is determined purely by their base rarity:
Orange
Red
Blue
etc.
Intermediate upgrade stages (like Exalted+) are ignored.

Devotion – How Points Are Generated
Inside the Shrine, there are two main sources of Devotion (points):

1️⃣ Manual / Automatic Clicking
Manual finger tapping at first
Later becomes automatic clicking
This source is handled only in the “Pray” tab
It is completely separate from the heroes and seats

2️⃣ Devotion from Heroes (Seats)
Generated by heroes placed into Shrine Seats
Seats unlock gradually:
Start with 1 seat
Expand up to 6 seats
Unlocking depends on story progression
Each seated hero continuously generates Devotion over time.


Devotion Display – Color Explanation
At the bottom of the Shrine screen, you’ll see three different colored values:

🟣 Purple – Base Devotion
Devotion generated from manual / automatic clicking
This is only related to the Pray system

🟠 Orange – Effective Devotion
The total devotion value generated by all seated heroes
Critical hits and critical damage are NOT included
This is the raw output of your seats

🔵 Blue – Faith per Second
The real, effective value of your shrine output
Represents the average devotion gained per second
This value includes all calculations over time

- General Pray (Manual Pray)
This is the manual finger-tapping pray, which later becomes the manual option (leftmost button at the bottom bar).

⚠️ Important:

General Pray is NOT linked to the normal shrine prayers.

It has its own separate system to generate additional points.

This mechanic becomes relevant later in the game, so don’t overfocus on it early.


Shrine Slots & God Placement
Each shrine slot provides different bonuses depending on the god placed.
Positioning matters:
Some gods are mainly used as fillers for global buffs (e.g. speed, crit, crit dmg).
Early on, it’s completely fine to use a god just for one strong global stat.


Global Buffs vs. Faction Buffs
Global buffs affect all gods and are usually more valuable early/mid game.
Faction buffs (e.g. Spada-only) become stronger once your lineup is more specialized.
That’s why gods with global speed / crit / crit dmg are often preferred.


Shrine Levels & Scaling
Shrine bonuses scale heavily with levels.
A weaker god with a strong global bonus can outperform a “better” god at low shrine levels.
Optimization becomes more important the higher your shrine level is.


When to Change Your Setup
You should consider adjusting your shrine when:

You unlock new gods with global buffs
Your main faction shifts (e.g. full Spada setup)
Your shrine reaches higher levels, where scaling matters more

- Artefacts
Artefacts are the equipment in the game that can be equipped on your heroes.
The Shrine is essentially the main source of equipment acquisition in the game.

⚠️ If you neglect this system:
Your heroes will die much faster
Or they will deal insufficient damage, especially later on
How do you obtain Artefacts from the Shrine?
Each Shrine level has a chance to drop Artefacts.

Important to note:
Artefact rarity is tied to your campaign progression
Campaign progress is required to obtain the “Red Flame”, which is needed to upgrade the Shrine
(Spoiler): Depending on your progress, the Shop can also provide this flame
Rarity & Drop Mechanics
Artefacts follow the same color-based rarity system as Talismans and Heroes
Drops are fully random
You cannot directly control which Artefact drops
You can only influence rarity by upgrading your Shrine

📈 What does this mean?
The further you progress in the campaign
The higher your Shrine level
The rarer and stronger the Artefacts you can obtain
Each Shrine level effectively represents a roll for potential equipment.
Shrine Stages & Rewards

Shrine stages are usually structured as:
One long challenge stage
Followed by two shorter stages

Every time you log in, the game shows:
How many points you gained
How many Artefacts dropped
Equipping Artefacts
You can equip Artefacts directly from the Artefact window

This is very convenient because:
The game shows which faction benefits the most from each Artefact’s bonus

- Seats
There are six seats in the Shrine, each with different mechanics and strengths.
Depending on which god you place in each seat, you can maximize the overall shrine output.
Below is a breakdown of each seat, starting from the top left.

Seat of Amplification
📍 Left side – Top
This seat provides a very high critical damage bonus.
🔹 Best usage:
Place a god with high crit rate
Or a god that shares critical damage percentage with other seats

This effect becomes available from seat level 500
At max level, this shared bonus scales even further

Seat of Celerity
📍 Left side – Middle
This is the seat with the highest prayer speed.
🔹 Best usage:
Place a god that benefits heavily from high speed

Additionally:
At higher seat levels, the seat itself gains a similar effect
(e.g. every 30 prayers, all other seats pray)
This creates strong chain-prayer synergies.

Seat of Devotion
📍 Left side – Bottom
This is the most balanced seat.
No special base mechanic
At higher levels, it shares a percentage of its prayer power with all other seats


Seat of Eminence
📍 Right side – Top
This seat has:
High crit rate
High crit damage
High devotion
With the right god, it can generate very strong point output.
 

Seat of Criticals
📍 Right side – Middle
This seat has the highest critical rate of all seats.
🔹 Best usage:
Gods that scale heavily with crit rate

📈 Later on, this seat also gains additional speed, increasing its value even more.

Seat of Might
📍 Right side – Bottom
This seat has the highest devotion value in the entire shrine.
At higher levels, it shares a percentage of its devotion with other seats
🟦 Spada Build Example: Poseidon
Perfect fit for a devotion-heavy seat that later supports other

- Talismans
Talismans

Talismans must be obtained from a separate area of the game and add another very interesting layer to the shrine system, making it even more impactful.

Talismans provide various effects that directly interact with your shrine seats.
How do you obtain Talismans?

Whenever you choose Divination at the Oracle, you can perform a fortune reading with your favorite god.

From this divination (card reading), you will receive a Talisman as a reward at the end.
The Talisman can be found in the shrine under the “Talisman” section.
After completing a divination, the game usually prompts you to return to the shrine and use the Talisman immediately —
this is optional, you don’t have to use it right away.

Examples of Talisman Effects
Talismans you may encounter include effects such as:

Increased seat click rate (Global Speed)
Increased base devotion
Increased effective devotion
Increased faith per second
Increased critical chance
Increased critical damage

All of these effects temporarily enhance your shrine performance.
Duration & Rarity
Talismans are time-limited — their effects are not permanent.

Depending on rarity, they can last for several hours up to a full day or longer.
Similar to gear and heroes, Talismans come in different rarity tiers, represented by familiar colors:

Rarity order:
Purple
Yellow
Red
Turquoise
White / Grey / Blue (matte)
Rainbow shimmer (highest rarity)

- Top Shrine Setups:
(6 Heroes can be displayed here - I want them to be configurable by a json)
The structure here should be 3x3 Heroes (left columns, right column, center column will be empty, background image behind all 3 columns)
