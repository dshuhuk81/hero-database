# Tower Defense Roadmap

Last updated: September 25, 2026. Completed work -> [TOWER_DEFENSE_ARCHIVE.md](TOWER_DEFENSE_ARCHIVE.md).

## What's next (priority order)

Nothing scheduled. Map work is handled separately and archived. Awakening shipped (see archive).

Ideas not scheduled: level-3 focus choice (attack, health or small range bonus) if runs feel samey after Awakening.

## Research notes (September 25, 2026)

**Sprites from game art** (all three options done, September 25, 2026):

1. Hero tokens shipped: `scripts/build-td-tokens.mjs` crops head-and-shoulders cutouts from the full-body hero art on R2 (already transparent, no background removal needed), per-hero crop fixes in `src/data/tdTokenCrops.json`, output `public/td/tokens/{id}-v1.webp`, uploaded to R2 `td/tokens/`. The board draws them with the head overlapping the level ring and a ground shadow; heroes without a token keep the circle portrait.
2. AI enemy sprites: done. Generated with Coplay (`gpt_image_1`, medium quality, transparent background, about $0.04 each; needs a running Unity Editor with the Coplay package, for example `~/android/assetripper/newtry/ExportedProject`; the Gemini provider returned 404). Sources in that project under `Assets/td_sprites/`, sprites uploaded to R2 `td/enemies/sprites/`. Prompts need "entire body visible, wide empty margin" or the subject gets cropped. Prompt template and steps in `src/game/td/sprite-spec-for-ai.md`; `scripts/build-td-enemy-sprites.mjs <folder>` normalizes the images to `public/td/enemies/sprites/{kind}-v1.webp`; the renderer prefers them over portraits (unmasked, ground shadow, faces its direction of travel). Only the 5 enemy kinds and Baphomet are needed.
3. Game Spine data: cracked. The skeleton bundles are not encrypted, only prefixed with a 46-byte decoy UnityFS header; `~/android/extract_spine_bundle.py` extracts skeleton (Spine 4.0.51 binary), atlas and textures. Verified with Ares and Poseidon, rendered with the Spine 4.0 web player. Limits: hero spines only have showcase animations (`entry`, `idle`, `interaction`), no combat moves, and enemies and bosses are 3D models in the game (no Spine). The official Pixi 8 Spine runtime needs Spine 4.2, so the practical route is pre-rendering the idle loop to sprite sheets offline. Shipped September 25, 2026: the recruit sheet shows the hovered or focused hero's idle loop (24-frame sprite sheets in R2 `td/anims/`, loop lengths in `src/data/tdHeroAnims.json`). Pipeline: `scripts/td-spine/` (extractor copy, `heroes.json` TD id -> bundle name, `render-sheets.cjs` renders frames with the Spine 4.0 player in headless Chromium). One skeleton (Jormungandr) is JSON instead of binary.

## Dev commands

```
npm run test:tower-defense      # headless combat/upgrade/virtue checks
npm run test:td-balance         # 5-squad balance harness
npm run td:sweep                # difficulty sweep (enemy HP steps x squads x maps)
npm run build:game-balance      # regenerate hero balance (re-ranks all heroes)
npm run check                   # astro check (TD code is type-clean; rest of site not yet)

node scripts/build-td-tokens.mjs [--only id] [--sheet out.png]   # board tokens -> public/td/tokens
node scripts/build-td-enemy-sprites.mjs <folder>                   # AI enemy art -> public/td/enemies/sprites
PW=<playwright dir> node scripts/td-spine/render-sheets.cjs        # hero idle loops -> public/td/anims
node scripts/upload-to-r2.mjs --prefix td/<folder>                 # upload new files (never overwrites)
```

`window.tdGame` and `window.tdRenderer` available in browser for debugging.

## Known gaps / deferred

- Sound variants not listening-pass verified
- Kill-count quest type was offered and not picked
- Mobile / landscape layout (large scope, deferred)
- Endless mode, 20-wave mode, leaderboard, replays (deferred per original spec)
