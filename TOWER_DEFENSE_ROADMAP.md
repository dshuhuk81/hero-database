# Tower Defense Roadmap

Last updated: September 25, 2026. Completed work -> [TOWER_DEFENSE_ARCHIVE.md](TOWER_DEFENSE_ARCHIVE.md).

Map implementation must use the asset assignments in [map.md](map.md), including the prepared Sunscar Ruins art for Map 3.

## What's next (priority order)

Map work is handled separately and archived. Only open work is listed here; done milestones move to the archive. Milestones below are in priority order; each one lists what "done" means.

**Status September 25, 2026.** M1, M5, M6 and M7 are done and archived. Next up: M4, then M8 and M9. M2 (leaderboard) and M3 (sound pass) come last.

### M4: Divine Blessings tuning (next)

- The tree itself shipped (archive, [docs/tower-defense-blessings-research.md](docs/tower-defense-blessings-research.md) section 7). This milestone is the follow-up once endless mode exists.
- Goal: full progression is needed somewhere. Today the full tree wins at about 4 to 5x enemy HP while the 10-wave mode runs at 2x.
- Scope: balance bots that buy blessings (so `td:sweep` measures real progression), pacing check (trunk about 128 runs, a class branch 11 to 21 runs with two heroes), endless waves as the power sink, maybe a cap on vertical bonuses. Later, if class branches feel alike: per-hero capstones.
- Done when: a sweep with bought blessings shows endless runs getting longer with progression, and the 10-wave mode is not trivial before about half the trunk.
- Also decide: endless earns Favor per wave with no cap (farmable), left open by M1.

### M8: Details in the Game & Divine Blessing tree UX/UI
- we have all class icons (roles are they called in the database) in the correspondent hero json files like e.g. `src/data/heroes/amunra.json`for archer, warrior, tank, mage, support. we can use that and get add them to text labels. e.g. in the Divine Blessing tree. -> Use Icons.
- The Divine Blessing tree currently has a lot of text issues where text is place inline. In most cases it would be better to make a line break and put text underneath. Analyse the Blessing page for better readability.

### M9: Others
- It should be possible to remove (sell) heroes from the battlefield.
- Some enemies just rush through tanks and assassins without being stopped.

### M2: Leaderboard (large, needs design first)

- Goal: shared scores across players.
- Blocker: needs an anti-tamper design before any code (see spec section 9); a plain client-submitted score endpoint would be a cheat form. Likely path is a Cloudflare Worker plus D1.
- Done when: the anti-tamper approach is agreed, then built.
- Only in Endless Mode maybe?

### M3: Sound variant listening pass (postponed)

- Postponed until all hero sounds are in. The in-game sound files still carry internal game names, so they have to be sorted and renamed by hand first, then 1 attack and 1 ultimate sound picked per hero from about 8 files.
- Goal: every sound variant in `src/game/td/audio.ts` has been heard in a real run and judged OK.
- Scope: play through both maps, trigger each variant, note clipping, volume jumps or repetitive-sounding picks; fix or drop bad variants.
- Done when: each variant is marked verified (or removed), and the known gap is closed.

## Research notes (September 25, 2026)

**Sprites from game art** (all three options done, September 25, 2026):

1. Hero tokens shipped: `scripts/build-td-tokens.mjs` crops head-and-shoulders cutouts from the full-body hero art on R2 (already transparent, no background removal needed), per-hero crop fixes in `src/data/tdTokenCrops.json`, output `public/td/tokens/{id}-v1.webp`, uploaded to R2 `td/tokens/`. The board draws them with the head overlapping the level ring and a ground shadow; heroes without a token keep the circle portrait.
2. AI enemy sprites: done. Generated with Coplay (`gpt_image_1`, medium quality, transparent background, about $0.04 each; needs a running Unity Editor with the Coplay package, for example `~/android/assetripper/newtry/ExportedProject`; the Gemini provider returned 404). Sources in that project under `Assets/td_sprites/`, sprites uploaded to R2 `td/enemies/sprites/`. Prompts need "entire body visible, wide empty margin" or the subject gets cropped. Prompt template and steps in `src/game/td/sprite-spec-for-ai.md`; `scripts/build-td-enemy-sprites.mjs <folder>` normalizes the images to `public/td/enemies/sprites/{kind}-v1.webp`; the renderer prefers them over portraits (unmasked, ground shadow, faces its direction of travel). In the game: the 5 enemy kinds, Baphomet (`boss-v1`), Lilith (`boss-lilith-v1`) and her children (`brood-v1`); the renderer loads the map's boss sprite.
3. Game Spine data: cracked. The skeleton bundles are not encrypted, only prefixed with a 46-byte decoy UnityFS header; `~/android/extract_spine_bundle.py` extracts skeleton (Spine 4.0.51 binary), atlas and textures. Verified with Ares and Poseidon, rendered with the Spine 4.0 web player. Limits: hero spines only have showcase animations (`entry`, `idle`, `interaction`), no combat moves, and enemies and bosses are 3D models in the game (no Spine). The official Pixi 8 Spine runtime needs Spine 4.2, so the practical route is pre-rendering the idle loop to sprite sheets offline. Shipped September 25, 2026: the recruit sheet shows the hovered or focused hero's idle loop (24-frame sprite sheets in R2 `td/anims/`, loop lengths in `src/data/tdHeroAnims.json`). Pipeline: `scripts/td-spine/` (extractor copy, `heroes.json` TD id -> bundle name, `render-sheets.cjs` renders frames with the Spine 4.0 player in headless Chromium). One skeleton (Jormungandr) is JSON instead of binary.

## Dev commands

```
npm run test:tower-defense      # headless combat/upgrade/virtue checks
npm run test:td-balance         # 5-squad balance harness
npm run td:sweep                # difficulty sweep (enemy HP steps x squads x maps)
npm run td:classes              # class identity report (M6 criteria: matrix, class removal, one-class squads)
npm run build:game-balance      # regenerate hero balance (re-ranks all heroes)
npm run check                   # astro check (TD code is type-clean; rest of site not yet)

node scripts/build-td-tokens.mjs [--only id] [--sheet out.png]   # board tokens -> public/td/tokens
node scripts/build-td-enemy-sprites.mjs <folder>                   # AI enemy art -> public/td/enemies/sprites
PW=<playwright dir> node scripts/td-spine/render-sheets.cjs        # hero idle loops -> public/td/anims
node scripts/upload-to-r2.mjs --prefix td/<folder>                 # upload new files (never overwrites)
```

`window.tdGame` and `window.tdRenderer` available in browser for debugging.

## Known gaps / deferred

Replays were dropped (September 25, 2026). Open items left by archived milestones:

- M5: rushers get past mainly because of the block limit (Tank 3, Warrior 2, Assassin 1), not because blockers die. If they still leak in real play, raise the block limits or slow runners on contact.
- M6 criterion 2: the mixed squad does as well without Warriors (endless 28.5 vs 28.0). Give Warriors something only they do in full runs, e.g. more swarm pressure, or cleave that also hits enemies held by neighbouring blockers. Check with `npm run td:classes`.
- M6 criterion 3: three Mages alone win Verdant on every seed; Verdant is the easiest map for every squad and needs its own tuning.
